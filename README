TODO: since the switch from homesick to vcsh, this file ends up in $HOME, so either remove it or rewrite it to be appropriate

For Command-T:
    cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t/
    rake make

For Several vim Plugins:
    cd ~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ...
    git submodule foreach git pull origin master

To remove a submodule you need to:
    Delete the relevant line from the .gitmodules file.
    Delete the relevant section from .git/config.
    Run git rm --cached path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
    Commit and delete the now untracked submodule files.

    TODO: move reattach-to-user-namespace to brew, don't have custom build in ~/bin/

        system and which binary path to use?
